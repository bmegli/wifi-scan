/*
 *  This example retrieves information only from associated AP (Access Point).
 *  wifi_scan_station function may be called at high frequency without affectining the link
 *  
 *  The signal strength retrieved comes from last received PPDU (physical layer protocol data unit).
 *  You may want to average the value over some reads.
 * 
 *  Program expects wireless interface as argument, e.g:
 *  wifi-scan-station wlan0
